# pythonproject_TrackerActivities
Tracker Activities
A project using the Python scripting language. This aims to design a daily activity tracker that ensures real-time data monitoring as well as user security.
This project was built using the Django framework.
This is a basic project. I use a venv for this. I work with django and django-admin. It has core files added by default using startapp. This project contains pygal , which is like plotly or matplot.
